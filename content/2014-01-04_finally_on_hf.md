Title: Finally on HF

For Christmas I got a Yaesu FT-897D plus the LDG AT-897plus and the FP-30 build in power supply for the FT-897D.  Pretty happy with the combination.  Very compact and very usable.  My first setup was out in the backyard with my portable antenna setup, but I added a 10 meter 1/2 wavelength wire dipole.  Worked okay, but by the time I was setup, it was evening.  10m usally sucks in the evenings.  It was also really cold that day so I packed it up and figured out how to get an antenna fed into the house.  Next day I put up a 10m 1/2 wave wire dipole on the roof, fed with some tv twin lead into my office window.  then the twin lead to a 4:1 balun then coax into the radio.  Worked pretty well.  First HF contact was PU5AEC in Southern Brazil.  There was some kind of contest in Brazil that weekend so I picked up a couple Brazilian contacts.

Also got my PSK31/Data interface working nicely.  Have been able to work PSK31 with Canada and USA so far.
