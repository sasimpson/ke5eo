title = "Fusion Site Suggestions"
+++

I have had a few people email me and ask if I could make some improvements to the [fusion](http://fusion.ke5eo.com) site.  I love suggestions and would be happy to try some of them out.  There are limitations to what I can do with the data, such as one suggestion to show what the active nodes were per room.  That data isn't presented to me in any consumable way, so until it is, I cannot add it.  But, with that, please make suggestions, shoot me an email at ke5eo at arrl.net and I'll add it to the backlog!
