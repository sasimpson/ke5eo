Finally had some QSL cards made.  I didn't really want to go overboard, so I went with [cheapqsls.com](http://cheapqsls.com)
and have been really happy with the quality and speed of delivery.  Coupled with some #6-3/4 envelopes I was able to get
the first batch out.  I sent a bunch to places where I wanted a card back or needed one for DXCC, since I didn't have a
confirmation via LoTW.  Remember, I you want a card, and send me one, I will send one back!
