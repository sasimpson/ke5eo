After my Extra upgrade I wanted to change my call to something that was for an Extra operator.  I also wanted to get something that would be shorter for CW.  My old call was quite long and this new call is very "small" in CW.  I wanted to keep region 5 and the EO stands for both my daughter's first names.  So I'll keep the KF5WAY domain up for now, linking back to the ke5eo.com domain until it expires or someone else wants it!  Update your links!
