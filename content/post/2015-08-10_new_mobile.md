I went to the Austin Summerfest with the purpose of finding the FTM-100DR.  I have
to say i'm pretty pleased with it.  I had a Wouxon unit, so the power and mounting
bracket fit right up nicely.  I had to make a patch to lengthen the mic cable,
although it came with a nice, long cable for the face plate.
