With the new year I've decided to document some of my 2017 ham radio goals/resolutions.  

* Finish learning CW by being able to RX by ear.   I can send okay at this point, but I really can't *hear* it yet.  
* Make at least 50 CW contacts this year.  Last year I made 6 CW contacts.  I feel like I can hit 50 this year.  I've already got 2!
* Participate in at least 5 contests.  While I only made 7 contacts in the ARRL RTTY Roundup, I submitted my logs!  I plan on working Winter Field Day.  This doesn't include Field Day with the club.
* Operate QRP some, out in the field.  We've got some nice state parks in Texas, might as well get out and operate in a few.  Maybe I should even do the TXSPOTA contest.

I don't think these are lofty and there aren't too many so plenty doable.
