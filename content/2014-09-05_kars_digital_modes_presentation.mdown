I was asked if I could present on digital modes to my club, the 
[Kendall Amateur Radio Society](http://www.kb5tx.org), and last night I gave a 
presentation.  It wasn't a deep dive into how each digital mode works, but a 
quick glance at the world of digital modes for the group. 

Here is the [presentation]({filename}/files/kars_digital_modes.pdf).
