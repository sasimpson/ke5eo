Title: Field Day 2015

We had a good field day in spite of the low turn out.  KARS usually has 8 or 9 stations, but this year we only had 5.  Still we made around 1400 contacts as 5A KB5TX.  My setup with the Energizer 2200watt generator worked great!  I got 10 hours on the eco setting running my radio.  I was able to work digital on 15 and 20 meters.  We had an issue with N3FJP late in the contest, with about 15 minutes left.  About 6 hours of logs were missing, but I was able to recover them from a backup.
